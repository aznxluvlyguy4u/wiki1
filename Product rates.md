This section describes adding **rates** to a products

In order to let the OP platform properly function, rates _must_ be setup _for every_ product in Current RMS.

# Adding rates to a product

We assume you already are familiar with setting up rates as this is a core functionality that you are probably already use.

Here we set out adding rates per item (if you have more efficient ways of adding rates, by all means please do so). The main concern here is that: *all products in Current RMS ** must have** rates setup **for all the stores it has a stock on** in order to let the OP platform function properly.*

- Go to a given product details page in Current RMS
- Scroll down to the _Rates_ section 
- Edit the rate for _Rental_ and add a rate for the given store
